I have earned few friends in Hyderabad.
I have visited kerala(Trivandrum), for ILP Training.
For two months i have lived there i.e, from 9th NOV 2017 to 9th JAN 2018
I love that place.
I have visited many places there.
Saint Andrews Beach , Kanyakumari ,floating bridge ,water falls, Kovalam beach and Punmodi hills.
Floating bridge is my favourite one.
In Kovalam , the speed boat journey was awesome and unforgettable.
Punmodi is a Windy place.I loved it.
Kerala is a green and pleasant place with plenty of coconut Trees ðŸŒ².
                 
                 
                 This is one of my unforgettable memory.
